<h3 class="story">The story</h3>

<p class="first paragraph">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <p class="villagers"><q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</p></q> The farmer said, <p class="farmer"><q>Maybe.</p></q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <p class="farmer"><q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</p></q> The farmer again said, <p class="farmer"><q>Maybe.</q></p>

<p class="second paragraph">The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,<p class="villagers"><q>Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,</q></p> and the farmer responded, <p class ="farmer"><q>Maybe.</q></p> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <p class="farmer"><q>Isn’t that great!</q></p> Again, he said, <p class="farmer"><q>Maybe.</q></p></p>

<p class="third paragraph">The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span>— because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</p>

<h4 class="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<blockquote><span class="good">Good</span> and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</blockquote>
